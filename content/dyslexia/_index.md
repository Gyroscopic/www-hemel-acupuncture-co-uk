### What is Dyslexia?
Dyslexia is a specific learning difficulty that mainly affects the development of literacy and language related skills. It is likely to be present at birth and to be lifelong in its effects.

It is characterised by difficulties with phonological processing, rapid naming, working memory, processing speed and the automatic development of skills that may not match up to an individual’s other cognitive abilities.

It tends to be resistant to conventional teaching methods, but its effect can be mitigated by appropriately specific intervention including the application of information technology and supportive counselling.’ BDA 2007

#### If these statements apply to your child, you may want to think about a dyslexia assessment:

* They are bright and articulate but when it comes to putting pen to paper they really struggle
* They surprise you and their teachers because in every other way they are bright and alert
* They love listening to stories but do not enjoy reading for themselves
* They find it difficult to rhyme
* They have good and bad days for no apparent reason
* They muddle up their words eg ‘psketti’ for ‘spaghetti’
* They sometimes have difficulty thinking of the correct word for something
* They put letters and numbers the wrong way round
* They confuse b and d and no and on
* They have a poor sense of direction
* They confuse left and right
* They are generally disorganised
* They confuse places dates and times
* They have great difficulty with spelling
* They have no sense of number and finds maths really difficult
* You have spoken to the school but they say ‘he/she will grow out of it’
* You are still very concerned and your gut feeling is that something is not right

A child with dyslexia/dyscalculia will NOT have all of these symptoms but they WILL have several of them.

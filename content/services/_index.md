I can offer the following for schools:

* Training on understanding dyslexia

* Training on understanding dyscalculia

* Classroom strategies to support you dyslexic learners

* Classroom strategies to support you dyscalculic learners

* Training on dyslexia friendly classrooms

* Training on working cooperatively with teaching assistants

* Training for TAs on how to support children with learning difficulties

* Bespoke training on a range of SEND issues

* Visual stress screening

* Dyslexia and Dyscalculia assessments

I am aware that funding is a huge issue for schools at present, but I try to keep my charges as reasonable as I can. Also, as I am sure you are aware, Pupil Premium Funding can be spent on training and assessment.

##### April 2012

"I have known Janice Rolnick professionally since 2000. I was her line manager when she was an advanced skills teacher specialising in pupils with SEN in primary schools. She delivered whole school INET particularly in relation to training for teachers and teaching assistants collaborating and working together.

In this role Janice worked with SENCOs and Inclusion Cordinators supporting their role in school and providing INSET.
She also provided a range of training for Teaching Assistants covering a wide range of areas including dyslexia. Janice has a vast array of knowledge and experience that encompasses pupils of all abilities and disabilities.

One of her many roles was as a Tutor to Teaching Assistants participating in a year long Specialist Teaching Assistant Course validated by London Metropolitan University. This course ran from 2003 until 2010. This involved delivering degree standard lectures, tutoring participants, marking essays and feeding back constructively to a range of very experienced teaching assistants.

Janice is an experienced and well respected teacher and trainer whom I have worked with over a number of years. She produces quality work and is consistently reliable.

Please feel to contact me for further information."

"Janice has a wealth of experience in providing advice and guidance across the wide range of SEN issues in school and for setting up and monitoring interventions.

She presents highly effective INSET, runs Pupil Progress Meetings, writes focused IEPs and is very successful in preparing evidence for children in need of a statutory assessment.

She has a particular strength in the field of dyslexia. Her liaison with outside agencies including educational psychologists, child psychotherapists and social workers is also highly effective and supports her role as a named Child Protection Officer.”

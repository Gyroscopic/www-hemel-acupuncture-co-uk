#### Frozen Shoulder
Frozen shoulder (capsulttis) is generally considered to be a spontaneous, progressive pen-arthritis over the shoulder joint. The exact causes of this condition are still not fully under-stood, and conventional treatments include cortisone injections and physiotherapy, neither of which are particularly successful in the majority of cases. For this reason, researchers at the Department of Anaesthesiology, Taipei Municipal Chung-Hsing Hospital con-ducted a study to determine the relative pain relief effect of electroacupuncture (EAP), regional nerve block (RNB) and the combination of EAP + RNB for frozen shoulder.<br>

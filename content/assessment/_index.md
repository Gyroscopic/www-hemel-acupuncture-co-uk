#### What are the benefits of a diagnostic assessment?

Usually it comes as a relief to both parent and child to understand the reason the child has been struggling. The diagnostic assessment highlights both strengths and weaknesses, which helps the school and /or specialist teacher to draw up an appropriate programme of support. One of the main benefits of an assessment is that the child understands they are not ‘lazy’ or ‘stupid’ but that they learn in a different way to others.

#### At what age can a child be assessed?

It is never too late to assess but the earlier the diagnosis is made, the sooner intervention can be put in place. Being unable to keep up in class can cause frustration, anxiety, low self -esteem and feelings of lack of self -worth. Early diagnosis can prevent many of these negative feelings.  Assessment can take place from 6 and a half onwards.

#### How long does the assessment take?

A full diagnostic assessment takes 2-3 hours. Following the assessment you will receive a detailed report with a diagnosis and comprehensive recommendations.

#### Where  and when does the assessment take place?

I assess in my own home at Chorleywood or I will travel to your home. I do not assess after school as the child is too tired so I either assess during school holidays or I ask the you to take the child out of school for a morning

#### Can I observe  the assessment?

I ask parents to leave the child with me, or if this is a problem wait in another room while the assessment is taking place. This is because children often perform differently when their parents are present. If you are concerned the best option is for the assessment to take place in your home.

#### How quickly can I get an appointment?

I can usually see your child within a few weeks of the initial enquiry.

#### Do you liaise with the school?

With your permission I ask the school to provide information about your child via a  questionnaire. I can also go into school to provide feedback, attend meetings or help set up programmes of intervention if required.

#### Do you provide a tuition service?

I do not tutor myself but I always endeavour to find you a suitably qualified tutor within easy reach of your home.

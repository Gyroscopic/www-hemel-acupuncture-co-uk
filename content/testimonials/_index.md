"Martin is excellent, i have a recurring problem and have been 2-3 times and every time he has managed to sort it out. 
I recently had a problem with my knee and even after the first session i noticed a huge difference."

I ripped the tendons in my thumb and nothing helped the pain. I tried my GP, who prescribed tablets, but I was in pain 24 hours a day for months. Then someone suggested acupuncture. It hadn't occured to me that this would help, and after 3 sessions I was pain-free. I also suffered from back pain, and acupuncure worked a treat!<b><br>

I have suffered with PMT for many years and I thought I had nothing to lose, so I tried Chinese herbs. Martin asks you lots of questions about your symptoms, then looks at your tongue and takes your pulse. He gave me herbs in capsules so I don't taste a thing. My only regret is that I didn't try them sooner. I can't tell you how brilliantly they have worked (Just ask my son!)

My back pain was so bad I could hardly get in and out of my car. Martin's acupuncture worked straight away; I felt the benefits after the first session! Now I can bend over without worrying about my back. Highly recommended!

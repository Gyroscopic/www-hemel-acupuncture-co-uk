{{< figure src="/uploads/Janice Rolnick.jpg" alt="Janice Rolnick" class="pull-right-sm">}}I have been working with dyslexic children for over 30 years. I strongly believe that children with dyslexia can be successful; they just need teachers who understand them, believe in them and know how to help them. With appropriate assessment and support the skyâ€™s the limit!

Until recently I was an Associate Advisor for the London Borough of Barnet BPSI (Barnet Partnership for School Improvement.)  I currently run my own Educational Consultancy Service offering advice to parents, diagnostic assessments for Specific Learning Difficulties and training for schools on a wide range of SEN issues. I am also an assessor for the British Dyslexia Association. I constantly update my knowledge by attending Continuing Professional Development courses.

### I hold the following qualifications:

* Certificate in Education (Cambridge Institute 1977)

* RSA diploma (equivalent to  OCR Level 7) in teaching and assessing Pupils with Specific Learning Difficulties (1986)

* Masters in Education (SEN) University of Hertfordshire (1997)

* Certificate of Competence in Educational Testing (2010)

* Practising Certificate (PATOSS)

* Current enhanced DBS certificate.
